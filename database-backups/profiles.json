It also mentions the natural progression from this is to develop wholly online programs which has surfaced in the form of Graduate Online.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <strong>UniMelb Digital Learning Strategy</strong> was updated in May <strong>2015</strong>. This <strong><em>internal use only document</em></strong> outlines the</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>key strategic and enabling priorities in the area of technology supported teaching, learning and assessment</em>&rdquo;</p>\n<p>from the UniMelb elearning Strategy 2012-2014. It has three operational strands:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><strong>Campus based eLearning</strong>: develop and integrate within a range of curricula, technology- based learning resources and applications to enhance the learning experiences of existing campus-based students;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><strong>MOOCs</strong>: develop and deliver a portfolio of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in partnership with Coursera; and</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 11px;\"><strong>Graduate online learning (GO)</strong>: develop a business plan followed by a suite of premium quality wholly online graduate courses.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>To facilitate the first strand, all subjects must have a minimal presence in the LMS. Lecture capture is now opt-out, so most formal teaching space sessions are now recorded for students. This integrates eLearning into the curriculum at Melbourne. Staff are given a wide range of eLearning tools to use and support is available to assist them in the development of eLearning activities and artifacts.</p>\n<p>To support development in the first strand, Learning and teaching Initiative (LTI) Grants have been offered each year to staff wishing to either redevelop their online course offerings, or to create some innovative educational offering to enhance the students learning. A review on the 2012-2013 LTI Grants is available here: <a title=\"LTI grants\" href=\"http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1865938/UOM_LTI_Report_2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1865938/UOM_LTI_Report_2014.pdf</a></p>\n<p>UniMelb partnered with MOOC provider Coursera in 2012.

These subjects have upwards of 70 different teaching staff at various times throughout the year, and so guidance on where to upload what file is important. I also meet with all newly commencing staff one-on-one to walk them through the basics of the LMS and locating their relevant subjects, files, and support.</p>\n<p>I suppose we do a lot of ad hoc unstructured development when we respond to support requests. I rarely just fix the issue, mark the email read or close the ticket and move on. Unless the technology in question is very new, known to be buggy, requires advanced technical skills or high-level access, I'll almost always include step-by-step details of actions I took to resolve the issue, or demonstrate it in person, in case it comes up for the user again. Anecdotally, this is fairly successful, as I often won't hear about the issue again from that user for several years, until the technology is updated and the instructions aren't current.</p>"

The strategy responds to student demand for flexibility, while strengthening Melbourne's reputation for educational quality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The original eLearning Strategy of the University (2012-2014) set out key strategic and enabling priorities in the area of technology supported teaching, learning and assessment. This strategy underpinned three operational strands which were:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Campus-based eLearning and mobile learning: develop and integrate within a range of curricula, technology based learning resources and applications to enhance the learning experiences of existing campus-based students;</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MOOCs: develop and deliver a portfolio of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in partnership with Coursera; and</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Graduate online learning: develop a suite of premium quality wholly online graduate courses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">____________________</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><a title=\"Creating Effective Websites for University Teaching\" href=\"http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/1761243/CEW08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Effective Websites for University Teaching</a>: An educational framework (<strong>2008</strong>) is a guide that has been a foundational document for staff development at the University of Melbourne&rsquo;s (UniMelb).

From informal occasional Practical Pedagogy Seminars to formal study in the Graduate Certificate of University Teaching, many flexible options are offered to staff to accommodate something for everyone to advance their knowledge and experience in elearning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">This framework is being reviewed in 2016 to measure progress and assess applicability to the current educational climate.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">____________________</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Growing Esteem Strategy has evolved from the Melbourne Curriculum (previously the Melbourne Model) which was introduced in 2008. It has entered a second stage from the original Growing Esteem of 2010. The new stage is planned to take place from 2015-2020 and is outlined in a discussion paper. <a title=\"Growing Esteem\" href=\"http://growingesteem.unimelb.edu.au/documents/UoM_Growing_Esteem_2014_GreenPaper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://growingesteem.unimelb.edu.au/documents/UoM_Growing_Esteem_2014_GreenPaper.pdf</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Chapter 3 contains a section titled &lsquo;Embracing the online evolution&rsquo; which outlines some of the reasons why the University of Melbourne started providing MOOCs through Coursera. It also mentions the natural progression from this is to develop wholly online programs which has surfaced in the form of Graduate Online.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The UniMelb Digital Learning Strategy was updated in May 2015. This <em>internal use only document</em> outlines the</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">&ldquo;key strategic and enabling priorities in the area of technology supported teaching, learning and assessment&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">from the UniMelb elearning Strategy 2012-2014. It has three operational strands:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Campus based eLearning: develop and integrate within a range of curricula, technology- based learning resources and applications to enhance the learning experiences of existing campus-based students;</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">MOOCs: develop and deliver a portfolio of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in partnership with Coursera; and</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Graduate online learning (GO): develop a business plan followed by a suite of premium quality wholly online graduate courses.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To facilitate the first strand, all subjects must have a minimal presence in the LMS. Lecture capture is now opt-out, so most formal teaching space sessions are now recorded for students. This integrates eLearning into the curriculum at Melbourne. Staff are given a wide range of eLearning tools to use and support is available to assist them in the development of eLearning activities and artifacts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">To support development in the first strand, Learning and teaching Initiative (LTI) Grants have been offered each year to staff wishing to either redevelop their online course offerings, or to create some innovative educational offering to enhance the students learning. A review on the 2012-2013 LTI Grants is available here: <a title=\"LTI Grants\" href=\"http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1865938/UOM_LTI_Report_2014.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://melbourne-cshe.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1865938/UOM_LTI_Report_2014.pdf</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">UniMelb partnered with MOOC provider Coursera in 2012. In 2013 UniMelb delivered 7 MOOCs, enrolling 352,974 learners. 2014 saw 10 courses delivered with 291,964 enrolments. 2015 grew to 20 courses and 291,773 learner enrolments. As of 17th May 2016 9 courses have been delivered to 71,579 learners making over 1 million enrolments since the initial course. <a title=\"Coursera\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/unimelb\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.coursera.org/unimelb</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Lessons learnt from the MOOCs have been folded into advice given to UniMelb staff to apply in their technology enabled learning classes within the University.

A total of 114 academics across the three campuses completed the survey (n = 110; 21% response rate). Importantly, the survey was completed by both early adopters of technology and those who do not currently use technology in their learning and teaching. Thirty-five per cent of respondents were using technology delivery options for their f2f students while 53% did not use &lsquo;technological delivery options&rsquo;. Most of the academics using ICT to deliver teaching (84%) were teaching in an undergraduate degree program. Thirty-one per cent of respondents reported using technology in the delivery of a postgraduate degree. The largest proportion of respondents used technology to create &lsquo;online&rsquo; or beyond the classroom learning activities. Online activities were also used to support &lsquo;independent study&rsquo; (62%).</p>\n<p>Analysis of the free comment responses regarding how academics encourage independent learning through the use of ICT tools can be categorised into four groups. From highest to lowest: driven through formative and/or summative assessment; social interaction; provision of resources; and delivery mode of the course (e.g. compressed). Linked to assessment 95% of respondents were aware of Bb rubrics and 79% reported using rubrics.</p>\n<p>The survey found that a high proportion of respondents (88%) were using standard communication tools (e.g. Outlook and Bb) and while most respondents knew of social media, very few were users. Similarly, albeit fewer respondents, academics were using tools to share knowledge. However, when asked about the use of tools to curate knowledge, there were fewer respondents across a range of pre-identified tools.</p>\n<p>In the creative space most academics were using standard tools such as word and PowerPoint and 66% were using mind mapping tools. Less than 40% of the respondents reported using a screen capture tool. However, over 50% of respondents used some kind of recording tool to deliver lectures (voice: 18%; voice and image: 30%; streaming: 19%). Fourteen per cent and 27% were using &lsquo;Echo 360&rdquo; and &lsquo;Bb collaborate&rsquo; respectively. One respondent noted that while they did not record their lectures, students captured the lectures on their personal devices.</p>\n<p>It is clear from this survey that academics are seeking professional development in this space. Eighty-five per cent of respondents want to develop their skills in Blended Learning strategies and 79% want to hear about &lsquo;great ideas&rsquo; for activities. Importantly, respondents want technical support (74%). Respondents also reported that support must be ongoing and flexible given the time demands on academic staff, staff turnover and changes in technology.</p>\n<p>H:\\Kathie\\blended learning\\BL_Data_All_151207.pdf</p>"

At present ITAG is the body through which funds are allocated for strategic IT projects. However, this is done on a year by year basis and has largely excluded consideration of educational technologies. A Capital Investment Review is currently underway under the auspices of the Vice-President (Operations) and this will link consideration of the physical and virtual environments in the resource planning for the university. This change in approach is likely to support and enable a future focused planning process for TEL and better balance of resourcing between TEL systems and corporate systems.</p>\n<p>The planning for quality improvement is a component of the position descriptions in different areas of the university, and in that sense it is resourced, though the PDs may not reference TEL directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Corporate Systems Administration Officer UC5</em>: Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the Student Administration and Research Systems and other Corporate Systems as required.</li>\n<li><em>Educational Designer/Technologist UC 6/7</em>: Analyse the evaluation of courses and units delivered through blended delivery and online modes in order to develop and implement strategies to improve the quality of the student experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that most activities in the university are reliant on some technology or another, and rely on infrastructure such as the WiFi, the network, electricity for power etc, it is difficult to specify whether or not there is sufficient resourcing for the quality improvement of technology enhanced learning systems or not as a distinct and separate resourcing question.</p>\n<p>As expenditure relates to the &lsquo;student experience&rsquo; business units prioritise spending on Technologically Enhanced Learning against strategic and operational priorities. The overall coordination of resourcing is a managed process. Some components of the existing educational technology infrastructure were put in place as part of the SAFFIRE project.</p>\n<p>The core of the existing educational technology infrastructure, the learning management system (LMS - currently under review) has been in place for many years with significant expansion as part of the SAFFIRE project. The university maintains a focus on ongoing budget and technical support for UC&rsquo;s existing services, and &nbsp;puts in place processes that continually update, replace and/or add educational technology to enable and support learning and teaching innovation, good quality student learning experiences, and proper administrative management of the business of education. Educational technology infrastructure requires regular review and enhancement to respond to changing and emerging needs of UC and its students.</p>\n<p>The University has a reporting process where the educational technology &lsquo;owner&rsquo; provides the Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG) with information about the educational technology. This information includes, as appropriate and meaningful for each of the technology the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>usage in terms of student numbers;</li>\n<li>usage in terms of integration of that technology by academics into their teaching practice;</li>\n<li>usage in terms of its use for provision of UC Open or other community-facing initiatives;</li>\n<li>budget for licensing, upgrades, enhancements and support;</li>\n<li>impact of discontinuing the provision of the technology/service;</li>\n<li>rationale for ongoing funding and support of the technology/service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LEAG acts as a mechanism to recommend the purchase of educational technologies and provides input into the design of physical learning spaces that will be needed soon, or now, or in the future to enable delivery to new and existing student cohorts. LEAG&rsquo;s Terms of Reference include formal and informal learning environments, physical and virtual spaces. Purchasing and implementation of educational technology oversee the purchase and implementation of enabling and educational technologies to support the expansion and delivery of flexible learning at UC including for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>developing and implementing a customer relations management system to support a consolidated approach to managing student engagement&nbsp;and&nbsp;support.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>implementing an Identity Management System that provides access management, identity and access monitoring, auditing and reporting for accountability and directory services such as identity data centralisation, discovery and reuse.</li>\n<li>acquiring mobile learning applications to develop a student-friendly mobile platform accessible to both students and staff and that covers mobile corporate services including:</li>\n<li>enrolment and course progression;</li>\n<li>PC room availability;</li>\n<li>integration with LearnOnline;</li>\n<li>mobile UC search functionality;</li>\n<li>personalised information based on location.</li>\n<li>creating a webinar/virtual classroom capability and virtual classrooms to provide:</li>\n<li>tutorial-size virtual classroom teaching environment</li>\n<li>softphone capability</li>\n<li>ability to share screen, desktop and applications</li>\n<li>lab-style teaching, including online interaction, whiteboard sharing and raising hands to ask questions for students logging in remotely.</li>\n<li>enhanced lecture-streaming capability including live interaction;</li>\n<li>persistence of sessions to be replayed afterwards.</li>\n<li>upgrading Moodle capability including digital resource management and Mahara ePortfolio integration.</li>\n<li>participation in the conceptualisation of, and decisions around, learning space design and furnishing.</li>\n</ul>",

It notes that many evaluation processes are silent on technology enhanced learning. The University is in a transition in relation to the approach it is taking to quality assurance and is moving away from its existing reliance on a Unit Satisfaction Survey to a range of engagement and satisfaction metrics that provide a more faceted and immediate indication of students&rsquo; experiences.</p>\n<p>The UC Breakthrough Strategic Plan objectives specifically include &lsquo;Expand and enhance flexible learning&rsquo; which implies an increased and better use of technologies to support teaching practices and student learning. UC&rsquo;s focus on and commitment to technology enhanced learning is demonstrated through the Education Plan (with targets for flexible delivery) and the Flexible Learning Implementation Plan which included the establishment of the Learning Environments Advisory Group.</p>\n<p>The University is currently procuring a virtual learning environment (May 2016) which has included and extensive consultation process across the university community and the identification of the functional requirements from this consultation. The evaluation plan for this procurement focuses on the student and staff experience of the technology tools and services: simplification, integration, automation and function.</p>\n<p>UC has a strong focus on supporting and encouraging the use of technology for teaching purposes, but less explicit mechanisms for quality assuring its use. Student engagement metrics are largely focused on the levels of online engagement as demonstrated through levels of touch of the TEL environments. Other demonstrations of engagement are more difficult to capture.</p>\n<p>At an institutional level UC has an overarching Quality and Standards Framework. This references the UC Course Experience Questionnaire (UCCEQ) and the Student Services Survey (2011, 2013 but not scheduled to run again). The UC Course Experience Survey does not mention the technology enhanced component specifically, but does reflect the responding students&rsquo; views about the quality of their learning experience. The Student Services Survey has only been conducted in 2011 and has not been repeated. The 2011 results suggested that key areas for improvement were access to computing equipment and IT Help and support, but does not relate these IT issues to their learning specifically.</p>\n<p>Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG) was established to evaluate and advise the UEC and the DVCE on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes, as well as ongoing implications for learning space design. LEAG provides advice to the University Education Committee on the University&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments. However, it is not clear that LEAG focuses on TEL at the course and program level. It is more at the broader tools and infrastructure level.</p>\n<p>LEAG TOR</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the nature, quality and fitness-for-purpose of UC&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the types of learning spaces, learning space design and furnishings needed now, soon or in the future to enable delivery to new and existing student cohorts</li>\n<li>Lead and oversee the implementation of new or renewed learning environments.</li>\n<li>Determine if any issues relating to learning environments require discussion by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Undertake any other activities referred to it by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Report annually to the University Education Committee on its activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The CQF Statement of Principles includes: Units and courses provide a high quality learning experience for students that employ best-practice teaching and learning methods and relevant learning technologies; and Provide students with the opportunity for work integrated learning and international study experiences, and globally connected learning opportunities through technologies</p>\n<p>The course development process explicitly targets learning technologies by requiring proponents to address the principles of innovation and engagement, identified in UC&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. A capacity statement supports, that explicitly requires proponents to consider &lsquo;educational technology tools, creating diverse and effective online learning environments and experiences, and employing flexible pedagogies&rsquo;. The UC&rsquo;s Course Development Process has been fully operational since March 2016.</p>\n<p>The CQF also requires course monitoring and Annual Course Reporting. This will manifest as an adaptive quality enhancement model predicated largely on online experience through integration with the InterFace dashboard and associated data and analytics. Technology enhanced learning and appropriate use of technology for learning is an integral part of this model.</p>\n<p>The ITM Strategy includes a goal of <em>Transforming IT capability towards a borderless University taking a global position</em>. The Strategy includes &lsquo;Develop and promote ITM services to facilitate engagement and experience through technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Develop ITM consulting services to provide advice and leadership on technology for teaching, learning and research&rsquo;. &nbsp;The Strategy does not include a focus on quality assurance in relation to teaching and learning, or a focus on integrating technology specifically at a program or course level (see below). However, ITM supports a range of technology services that support the teaching enterprise such as the student management system (Callista), the timetabling system (Syllabus+), the tutorial management system (Allocate), Office265 and OneDrive, and these are integrated to greater and lesser degrees with the students&rsquo; learning experiences of their units and courses through either MyUC and/or the learning management system.</p>",

This change in approach is likely to support and enable a future focused planning process for TEL and better balance of resourcing between TEL systems and corporate systems.</p>\n<p>The planning for quality improvement is a component of the position descriptions in different areas of the university, and in that sense it is resourced, though the PDs may not reference TEL directly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Corporate Systems Administration Officer UC5</em>: Contribute to the ongoing improvement of the Student Administration and Research Systems and other Corporate Systems as required.</li>\n<li><em>Educational Designer/Technologist UC 6/7</em>: Analyse the evaluation of courses and units delivered through blended delivery and online modes in order to develop and implement strategies to improve the quality of the student experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given that most activities in the university are reliant on some technology or another, and rely on infrastructure such as the WiFi, the network, electricity for power etc, it is difficult to specify whether or not there is sufficient resourcing for the quality improvement of technology enhanced learning systems or not as a distinct and separate resourcing question.</p>\n<p>As expenditure relates to the &lsquo;student experience&rsquo; business units prioritise spending on Technologically Enhanced Learning against strategic and operational priorities. The overall coordination of resourcing is a managed process. Some components of the existing educational technology infrastructure were put in place as part of the SAFFIRE project.</p>\n<p>The core of the existing educational technology infrastructure, the learning management system (LMS - currently under review) has been in place for many years with significant expansion as part of the SAFFIRE project. The university maintains a focus on ongoing budget and technical support for UC&rsquo;s existing services, and&nbsp; puts in place processes that continually update, replace and/or add educational technology to enable and support learning and teaching innovation, good quality student learning experiences, and proper administrative management of the business of education. Educational technology infrastructure requires regular review and enhancement to respond to changing and emerging needs of UC and its students.</p>\n<p>The University has a reporting process where the educational technology &lsquo;owner&rsquo; provides the Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG) with information about the educational technology. This information includes, as appropriate and meaningful for each of the technology the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>usage in terms of student numbers;</li>\n<li>usage in terms of integration of that technology by academics into their teaching practice;</li>\n<li>usage in terms of its use for provision of UC Open or other community-facing initiatives;</li>\n<li>budget for licensing, upgrades, enhancements and support;</li>\n<li>impact of discontinuing the provision of the technology/service;</li>\n<li>rationale for ongoing funding and support of the technology/service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LEAG acts as a mechanism to recommend the purchase of educational technologies and provides input into the design of physical learning spaces that will be needed soon, or now, or in the future to enable delivery to new and existing student cohorts. LEAG&rsquo;s Terms of Reference include formal and informal learning environments, physical and virtual spaces. Purchasing and implementation of educational technology oversee the purchase and implementation of enabling and educational technologies to support the expansion and delivery of flexible learning at UC including for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>developing and implementing a customer relations management system to support a consolidated approach to managing student engagement&nbsp;and&nbsp;support.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>implementing an Identity Management System that provides access management, identity and access monitoring, auditing and reporting for accountability and directory services such as identity data centralisation, discovery and reuse.</li>\n<li>acquiring mobile learning applications to develop a student-friendly mobile platform accessible to both students and staff and that covers mobile corporate services including:</li>\n<li>enrolment and course progression;</li>\n<li>PC room availability;</li>\n<li>integration with LearnOnline;</li>\n<li>mobile UC search functionality;</li>\n<li>personalised information based on location.</li>\n<li>creating a webinar/virtual classroom capability and virtual classrooms to provide:</li>\n<li>tutorial-size virtual classroom teaching environment</li>\n<li>softphone capability</li>\n<li>ability to share screen, desktop and applications</li>\n<li>lab-style teaching, including online interaction, whiteboard sharing and raising hands to ask questions for students logging in remotely.</li>\n<li>enhanced lecture-streaming capability including live interaction;</li>\n<li>persistence of sessions to be replayed afterwards.</li>\n<li>upgrading Moodle capability including digital resource management and Mahara ePortfolio integration.</li>\n<li>participation in the conceptualisation of, and decisions around, learning space design and furnishing.</li>\n</ul>",

It notes that many evaluation processes are silent on technology enhanced learning. The University is in a transition in relation to the approach it is taking to quality assurance and is moving away from its existing reliance on a Unit Satisfaction Survey to a range of engagement and satisfaction metrics that provide a more faceted and immediate indication of students&rsquo; experiences.</p>\n<p>The UC Breakthrough Strategic Plan objectives specifically include &lsquo;Expand and enhance flexible learning&rsquo; which implies an increased and better use of technologies to support teaching practices and student learning. UC&rsquo;s focus on and commitment to technology enhanced learning is demonstrated through the Education Plan (with targets for flexible delivery) and the Flexible Learning Implementation Plan which included the establishment of the Learning Environments Advisory Group.</p>\n<p>The University is currently procuring a virtual learning environment (May 2016) which has included and extensive consultation process across the university community and the identification of the functional requirements from this consultation. The evaluation plan for this procurement focuses on the student and staff experience of the technology tools and services: simplification, integration, automation and function.</p>\n<p>UC has a strong focus on supporting and encouraging the use of technology for teaching purposes, but less explicit mechanisms for quality assuring its use. Student engagement metrics are largely focused on the levels of online engagement as demonstrated through levels of touch of the TEL environments. Other demonstrations of engagement are more difficult to capture.</p>\n<p>At an institutional level UC has an overarching Quality and Standards Framework. This references the UC Course Experience Questionnaire (UCCEQ) and the Student Services Survey (2011, 2013 but not scheduled to run again). The UC Course Experience Survey does not mention the technology enhanced component specifically, but does reflect the responding students&rsquo; views about the quality of their learning experience. The Student Services Survey has only been conducted in 2011 and has not been repeated. The 2011 results suggested that key areas for improvement were access to computing equipment and IT Help and support, but does not relate these IT issues to their learning specifically.</p>\n<p>Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG) was established to evaluate and advise the UEC and the DVCE on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes, as well as ongoing implications for learning space design. LEAG provides advice to the University Education Committee on the University&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments.

It is more at the broader tools and infrastructure level.</p>\n<p>LEAG TOR</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the nature, quality and fitness-for-purpose of UC&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the types of learning spaces, learning space design and furnishings needed now, soon or in the future to enable delivery to new and existing student cohorts</li>\n<li>Lead and oversee the implementation of new or renewed learning environments.</li>\n<li>Determine if any issues relating to learning environments require discussion by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Undertake any other activities referred to it by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Report annually to the University Education Committee on its activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The CQF Statement of Principles includes: Units and courses provide a high quality learning experience for students that employ best-practice teaching and learning methods and relevant learning technologies; and Provide students with the opportunity for work integrated learning and international study experiences, and globally connected learning opportunities through technologies</p>\n<p>The course development process explicitly targets learning technologies by requiring proponents to address the principles of innovation and engagement, identified in UC&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. A capacity statement supports, that explicitly requires proponents to consider &lsquo;educational technology tools, creating diverse and effective online learning environments and experiences, and employing flexible pedagogies&rsquo;. The UC&rsquo;s Course Development Process has been fully operational since March 2016.</p>\n<p>The CQF also requires course monitoring and Annual Course Reporting. This will manifest as an adaptive quality enhancement model predicated largely on online experience through integration with the InterFace dashboard and associated data and analytics. Technology enhanced learning and appropriate use of technology for learning is an integral part of this model.</p>\n<p>The ITM Strategy includes a goal of <em>Transforming IT capability towards a borderless University taking a global position</em>. The Strategy includes &lsquo;Develop and promote ITM services to facilitate engagement and experience through technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Develop ITM consulting services to provide advice and leadership on technology for teaching, learning and research&rsquo;.&nbsp; The Strategy does not include a focus on quality assurance in relation to teaching and learning, or a focus on integrating technology specifically at a program or course level (see below). However, ITM supports a range of technology services that support the teaching enterprise such as the student management system (Callista), the timetabling system (Syllabus+), the tutorial management system (Allocate), Office265 and OneDrive, and these are integrated to greater and lesser degrees with the students&rsquo; learning experiences of their units and courses through either MyUC and/or the learning management system.</p>",

The University is in a transition in relation to the approach it is taking to quality assurance and is moving away from its existing reliance on a Unit Satisfaction Survey to a range of engagement and satisfaction metrics that provide a more faceted and immediate indication of students&rsquo; experiences.</p>\n<p>The UC Breakthrough Strategic Plan objectives specifically include &lsquo;Expand and enhance flexible learning&rsquo; which implies an increased and better use of technologies to support teaching practices and student learning. UC&rsquo;s focus on and commitment to technology enhanced learning is demonstrated through the Education Plan (with targets for flexible delivery) and the Flexible Learning Implementation Plan which included the establishment of the Learning Environments Advisory Group.</p>\n<p>The University is currently procuring a virtual learning environment (May 2016) which has included and extensive consultation process across the university community and the identification of the functional requirements from this consultation.

The UC Course Experience Survey does not mention the technology enhanced component specifically, but does reflect the responding students&rsquo; views about the quality of their learning experience. The Student Services Survey has only been conducted in 2011 and has not been repeated. The 2011 results suggested that key areas for improvement were access to computing equipment and IT Help and support, but does not relate these IT issues to their learning specifically.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality and Improvements Advisory Group</strong> (QAIT) &ndash; high level advisory group which meets 6 times per year and provides advice to the Vice-President Operations on quality and improvement matters related to the scholarly and professional areas of the university.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG)</strong>: LEAG was established to evaluate and advise the UEC and the DVCE on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes, as well as ongoing implications for learning space design.</p>\n<p>LEAG provides advice to the University Education Committee on the University&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments.

The course development process explicitly targets learning technologies by requiring proponents to address the principles of innovation and engagement, identified in UC&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. A capacity statement supports, that explicitly requires proponents to consider &lsquo;educational technology tools, creat[ing] diverse and effective online learning environments and experiences, and employ[ing] flexible pedagogies&rsquo;. The UC&rsquo;s Course Development Process has been fully operational since March 2016.</p>\n<p>The CQF also requires course monitoring and Annual Course Reporting. This will manifest as an adaptive quality enhancement model predicated largely on online experience through integration with the InterFace dashboard and associated data and analytics. Technology enhanced learning and appropriate use of technology for learning is an integral part of this model.</p>\n<p><strong>Information and Technology Management Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The ITM Strategy includes a goal of <em>Transforming IT capability towards a borderless University taking a global position</em>.</p>\n<p>The Strategy includes &lsquo;Develop and promote ITM services to facilitate engagement and experience through technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Develop ITM consulting services to provide advice and leadership on technology for teaching, learning and research&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The Strategy does not include a focus on quality assurance in relation to teaching and learning, or a focus on integrating technology specifically at a program or course level (see below). However, ITM supports a range of technology services that support the teaching enterprise such as the student management system (Callista), the timetabling system (Syllabus+), the tutorial management system (Allocate), Office265 and OneDrive, and these are integrated to greater and lesser degrees with the students&rsquo; learning experiences of their units and courses through either MyUC and/or the learning management system.</p>\n<p><strong><em>integrate technology enhanced learning at both a program and course level</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Learning Implementation Plan (FLIP)</strong></p>\n<p>The FLIP is a sub-plan of the University&rsquo;s Education Plan. It is built on assumptions of flexibility, mobility and BYOD. It includes a range of planning and implementation activities to support the design, implementation, management and reporting of processes to update, replace and/or add educational technologies to enable and support learning and teaching innovation, quality student learning experiences, and proper administrative management of the business of education.</p>\n<p><strong>InterFace</strong></p>\n<p>InterFace is a web-based dashboard available to UC students and to unit conveners and other designated staff. It uses analytics to present students with real-time information about their progress towards completing their course and their progress and engagement with each unit in which they are enrolled. For unit conveners it can help build their understanding of the profile, performance and perceptions of students in their units. InterFace captures student engagement as expressed through their use of TEL environments, however, it does not explicit canvas their satisfaction with the TEL they experience. The questions they are asked are related to their satisfaction with their happiness, how well they think they have done, and the alignment of their unit with their career destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Recognition and Advancement Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching and Learning activities in staff development are designed to support the achievement of the UC Strategic Plan 2013-2017 and the associated Education Plan which have ambitious targets of growth via strategic partnerships nationally and internationally, and additional provision of flexible and online study opportunities for students.</p>\n<p>It provides staff with advice, support, information sessions, online learning, and innovation showcases as well as opportunities for accredited study and support for international certification in the areas of learning design, curriculum design, policy development and implementation, library resources and technical and other support in the effective pedagogical use of our learning technologies.</p>\n<p>The staff recognition and advancement activities are university-wide approaches to supporting the integration of technology into teaching and learning practice, and highlights the pedagogical applications of technology.</p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc447205275\"></a><em>Staff Development for Teaching and Learning Program (the Program)</em><em> includes:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online courses provided by third party providers that UC has purchased (For example, Epigeum&rsquo;s University and College Teaching modules, Blended Learning modules, open courses provided in MOOCs and/or OERu, Lynda.com resources),</li>\n<li>Activities scheduled by Teaching and Learning to provide staff with the opportunity to develop skills in UC learning technologies (see <a href=\"https://www.canberra.edu.au/myuc-s/business-units/dvce/tl/staff-development-and-support/workshop-registration\">https://www.canberra.edu.au/myuc-s/business-units/dvce/tl/staff-development-and-support/workshop-registration</a>), and/or to extend the tools, techniques, strategies and approaches to their own teaching practice and curriculum renewal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Graduate Certificate in Tertiary Education (GCTE)</em></p>\n<p>The GCTE has been redeveloped for delivery to UC (and some partner staff) from mid-2016.

We still haven&rsquo;t moved much beyond the compliance model.</p>\n<p>* There is an opportunity to improve communication and integration of TEL p/p/g into processes and systems with the review of the Learning Technologies Policy, revival of the Learning Technologies and Spaces Committee (replacing the iLearn Steering Committee) and the implementation of the L&amp;T Strategic Framework.</p>\n<p>* Some areas work very consciously (and conscientiously) to communicate information on TEL to staff (e.g. Faculty of Arts) but there is still mixed response in terms of integration in practice.</p>\n<p>* Participants returned to the problem of the compliance focus, with further discussion of their view that compliance burns out the most creative and innovative teachers &ndash; this is a casualty of standardisation. Standardisation treats the best teachers as poor performers subject to compliance. Branding is another factor in creating and maintaining a compliance and standardisation focus &ndash; why should all units, programs, iLearn sites, presentations look the same? How does this promote creativity and innovation?</p>\n<p>* Clearly TEL p/p/g are not well integrated into processes and systems because people get away with a fair bit of non-compliance, even to minimum standards &ndash; this should not be possible. Participants saw integration in terms of alignment with values and ideals as being very poor. Again little attention is paid to the cultural change aspects of promoting the use of TEL.</p>\n<p>* There is always a time lag between communication of strategy and the integration of strategic activities into practice at faculty and department level. It is particularly difficult to penetrate the unit level where practices are long-established. More resources and discipline-specific support are needed &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo;.</p>",

This is unsurprising, as they were selected precisely because of their diverse perspectives. See below under &ldquo;Interpretation issues&rdquo; for more detail on this discussion &ndash; it is important because it goes to the heart of the governance failures at Macquarie (not just in TEL).</p>\n<p>* Taking the narrower, &ldquo;values free&rdquo; interpretation of governance, the responses to the component measures are a fairly straightforward matter of looking at our governance structures and governing body membership under University By-Laws and Rules. In terms of the latter, we have a comprehensive set of governance bodies, from the Council and Academic Senate and their subcommittees through to Faculty Boards and Committees, accompanied by a clear and accessible policy framework. Membership of the academic governance bodies is inclusive of academic staff at all levels as well as management and administration in relevant academic and service areas.</p>\n<p>* There is an established institutional mechanism with stakeholder representation for the governance of TEL in particular, although this is spread over a number of bodies, from the former iLearn Steering Committee (replaced by the Learning Technologies and spaces committee) to the Senate Learning &amp; Teaching Committee, Quality &amp; Standards Committee and Senate itself, as well as the Finance &amp; Facilities Committee of University Council (in relation to budgets). Faculty level governance for L&amp;T is reasonably well established and this includes some aspects of local governance of TEL.</p>\n<p>* However, there were very mixed views amongst participants as to the effectiveness or impact of these mechanisms and structures, ranging from lack of knowledge of their existence and/or role in relation to TEL, to neutral or negative views of their effectiveness in the governance of TEL.</p>\n<p>* Governance was rated as &ldquo;maturing&rdquo; due to the current reshaping of TEL subcommittees, including the replacement of the iLearn Steering Committee by a revitalised Learning Technologies and Spaces Committee with updated terms of reference, connecting practice to development. Some participants stated that governance on the technical side is quite good (apart from budget issues), as there is now one committee on TEL that is a subcommittee of SLTC. Some participants pointed out that LT&amp;SC is not really a governance committee but an advisory body (SLTC is the governance body). Faculty Boards and Committees are also relatively new structures and operate differently in different faculties.</p>\n<p>* Some participants noted that although a range of stakeholders are &ldquo;represented&rdquo; on governance bodies and committees, staff as a stakeholder group tend to be fairly muted in discussion and in reality have little influence on decision-making, strategic directions and policy in relation to TEL.</p>\n<p>* There was also some critical questioning of the meaning and scope of the term &ldquo;governance&rdquo; in relation to TEL. To some participants, the boundary between governance and management roles in relation to TEL is very blurred and somewhat contested between those responsible for central decision-making, service provision, strategic leadership, budgeting and implementation functions. Individuals using TEL find the structures confusing at best and lacking in transparency at worst.</p>",

This indicates insufficient articulation of the operational structure at some levels (although faculty staff with TEL support roles are generally likely to have good knowledge of LTS as many of them either previously worked in LTC or had regular working relationships with those who did.</p>\n<p>* Where people are familiar with the work of the Learning Technologies unit (pre and post restructure) they generally see reporting lines and delegations as clear although not necessarily well could be better articulated.</p>\n<p>* At Faculty level, operational management of technologies for TEL is collaborative in the sense that the authority and responsibility involves Associate Dean of Learning and Teaching, Arts IT and the centrally located Learning and Teaching Services.</p>\n<p>* Some participants felt that policy and structures for operational management of TEL technologies (if supported) are clear; some agreed but stated that they appear to have little bearing on behaviours in relation to use of TEL; others felt that control, authority and responsibility are clear in practice but not articulated clearly in documentation.</p>",

There is essentially no policy framework or standard process (documented or practice-based) for the introduction of new technologies. Recent examples of large-scale introduction of new technology (e.g. the key elements of the MLTP and the adoption of student feedback software) were the subject of specific &ldquo;one-off&rdquo; projects with their own internal processes (needs analysis, consultation, showcases, pilots etc) rather than following a process governed by policy and procedures.</p>\n<p>* The reason for the variation in initial data collection was largely due to varying perspectives and assumptions that when new technologies are adopted, this has been in accordance with a policy framework and standard process. In discussion, participants from the different areas of the University shared their knowledge about this (or, more specifically, the lack of it) and realised that much of what appears to be following a process is in fact ad hoc, although generally managed well by the Learning Technologies group and faculty teams. There is some good practice at faculty level but this is not set out formally in policy or procedures. On the other hand, there is a perception at faculty level that decisions on the adoption of new technologies is &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;, arbitrary and lacking in consultation. Following this exchange of views, the group collectively came to the conclusion that the lowest rating is appropriate for all PMs associated with this PI.</p>\n<p>* Several participants expressed their frustration at the slow process of adopting technology &ndash; this was explained by others as reflecting the lack of clear framework and procedure coupled with the poor alignment to budgets (see PI3).</p>\n<p>* An operational initiative to remedy this situation following the restructure of L&amp;T support currently under way, with Learning Technologies Services establishing a process for requesting new technology that includes consultation between LIH, LTS and Faculty L&amp;T teams. On the governance side, participants expected that development of a policy framework and associated procedures and guidelines for adoption of new technologies would be a priority for the Learning Technologies and Spaces Committee.

A VPN service can be utilised to access files remotely.</p>\n<p>The IT support provided aligns with these services. There is a main IT Service Desk that links to information about accessing MyLO, email, mobile devices, and connecting to VPN and mobile devices. As well as the external support for MyLO through the Service Desk, there are three Help sections embedded within the learning management system. There is Student Help, Library Help, and IT Help. These link to services external to MyLO as well as resources embedded within MyLO. &nbsp;The eStudent Centre also has a Help section within that system that provides details about managing enrolments online. The IT Help services in the Library focuses on providing all support services in the online environment that are accessed traditionally face-to-face. The Library also links to a general Q&amp;A service, Ask Us. All the services are made available to all students regardless of their mode of study. This aligns with the adoption of the Blended Learning model (TELT White Paper) and does not privilege students studying via any particular study mode. However, no direct action has been taken to implement the Blended Learning Model consistently across the University.</p>\n<p>It has been a goal of the University to have an online presence in all units offered. This has been difficult to achieve from both educational and technological perspectives. In relation to the technology, when the LMS was first introduced in 2012/3 the implementation was successful due to strong project coordination between UTAS and the LMS developers, and adequate resourcing for infrastructure and staff training. Since then there has been staff losses, staff turnover, and a change in the administrative structures of the University that has impacted on the ability to maintain the connectedness among various University departments that is required to ensure the LMS platform is maintained, updated, and resourced. There have been inadequate change management strategies put in place to support the application and evolution of the LMS, which needs to occur for it to keep abreast with students&rsquo; use of new technologies and learning needs. The reduction in resources has had a negative impact on the alignment of the support services with the learning technologies over the past few years. That said, all of the essential services are covered but coordination and clear responsibility for some service provision are lacking.</p>\n<p>We used to be better at this than we currently are. &nbsp;When we first implemented the current LMS in 2102/3 there was strong project coordination and adequalte resource.

Typically, contact by phone is greeted by a &ldquo;all the operators are busy&rdquo; message and the option to wait or provide contact details, be placed in a queue, and receive a call back is given. When the call back selection was chosen, the call was returned but it took two hours for the call to reach the top of the cue. An email sent at the same time as the phone call was made was not answered within one working day.</p>\n<p>It should be acknowledged that academic staff are often a student&rsquo;s first port of call for all manner of problems and support in relation to TELT. Occasionally this is useful such as where there is a problem with a LMS unit that can be passed on to the relevant lecturer. This is often unseen workload and not necessarily part of the contacted person&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities. Some Faculties have dedicated Educational Developers responsible for supporting staff to deliver learning experiences online. For example, the Faculty of Education have a Senior Academic eLearning Pedagogue. In some faculties the Educational Developers support students directly (e.g., Faculty of Health, Understanding Dementia MOOC). They usually help a teaching staff member resolve issues but the teaching staff member communicates the possible solutions to the students (this is the case in Tasmanian School of Business and Economics).</p>\n<p>The main source of support for students using the LMS is the Service Desk. Problems arise, however, when the Service Desk staff do not have knowledge of or experience with MyLO to provide sufficient support students. The Service Desk staff are not given access to units at Support/Lecturer level so are limited in their ability to address or resolve problems encountered by students in a timely manner. Embedded in the LMS are learning objects that link to advice about the LMS functions. Similarly, the eStudent Centre has embedded Help links but as is the case with the LMS, the links are external to service and do not always open up in a new browser tab.

For example, Ask Us can be accessed from the Library page as well as the Student Support page. This has the advantage of students being able to access services without having to always work back to and from the one place but there is also the disadvantage that students do not always know from where they have accessed a service and find it difficult to return to that service in an efficient manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pathways to the IT Service Desk are widely, clearly and consistently communicated. Regular updates about IT Services are conveyed through email contact and advice about contacting IT Services is often attached to queries responded to by email. Requests for assistance can be made through the Log a Service Desk Job link on the IT Services homepage. The link takes students and staff alike, to a Service Portal that has four main options to choose from: Report an Issue; Request Something; Find Answers; and Other Services. Although useful, difficulties in navigating fluidly between the Service Portal and the Service Desk arise. For example, the Report an Issue link sends students to an external Service Portal via an email and password authentication process. Details about problems encountered can be added to a template and forwarded to the IT Services Support Team. The problem arises when the request is completed and the students try to return to the Service Desk. Instead, they are forwarded to an individualised Self Service Portal. It is then necessary to open a new browser tab to return to where they started. The Request Something option on the Service Portal is multi-layered. At first, a selection must be made from three options: Dell Services; Apple Devices; and Service Request. The problem arises when the options at the next level do not cover the problem sought to be answered. For example, a request to upload software is not one of the options under the Service Request option. Although not an issue as such, a request to upload software can only be requested via the Report an Issue option. The Service Request option would benefit from a contact template such as the one in the Report an Issue option. The Find Answers option leads to a FAQ list, which can be searched. Like all other FAQ services, it is only useful if the question pursued has been answered previously and there is the potential for the process to be time consuming and frustrating as users search for the relevant questions that provides the appropriate answers for their problems. Services like the FAQ list are usually provided to avoid answering the same question multiple times and their provision is used to justify reduced resourcing. However, decisions made for economic reasons do not always translate to positive experiences for students and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>"

As far as the benchmarking team were aware there are few statistics collected on the usage of the FAQs and none appear to be published.

They do not, however, provide data about access to or use of technological resources and services that support student learning. The statements that students respond to on the eVALUate surveys are phrased generally. For example, &ldquo;The learning resources in this unit help me to achieve the learning outcomes.&rdquo; The answers to this question are likely to be influenced by students&rsquo; experiences with the technology and associated services but that assumption cannot be made when analysing the data. Considering eVALUate is administered to every unit in every semester, it provides a prime opportunity for gathering data about students&rsquo; experiences with the technology and the way in which it supported their learning. The addition of three questions to a relatively short survey, as it stands, would yield data that could inform the development and prioritisation of IT Services and resources. This would be a relatively inexpensive and cost effective way to collect data. Feedback from online students is gathered in the Student Experience Survey completed upon graduation but this has only recently come to light and little use has been made of the data. Although useful, data from the SES would be retrospective and likely to be related to &ldquo;old technologies,&rdquo; whereas, collection of data via eVALUate surveys would provide &ldquo;just in time data&rdquo; that are directly relevant to the current students&rsquo; learning experience and application of &ldquo;current technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Teaching staff frequently get feedback from students but there is no formal way to capture that data.

There is some feedback from online students contained in the SES, but this has only recently come to light and little use has been made of this data.</p>\n<p>In the past university-wide surveys on the use of technology were conducted and had significant impacts on decision-making but these have not been administered since 2013. &nbsp;In the past, there was a proposal to participate in the Educause Centre for Analysis and Research survey about information technology in higher education, which is used to understand the role of IT in universities. Revisiting this idea may be useful.</p>\n<p>IT Service Quality Benchmark via systemsthinking.com.au was conducted in 2015. The benchmarking is in relation to the evaluation of and cataloguing of Self-Service initiatives. The relatively poor ranking in comparison with other universities in 2015 fed into a range of strategies in 2016. The development of self-service activities, such as the Student Support Services Ask Us and the IT Services Find Answers FAQs, are examples of how UTAS are utilising the notion of self-service to free up technical staff for higher value work. This places an emphasis on IT service delivery that focus on the presentation of knowledge for student consumption and interpretation.</p>\n<p>Available immediately, is research conducted at UTAS that is directly related to the use of learning technologies. Although it does not involve large scale survey data, the findings could inform areas of need and give direction to future research that could inform decision-making about the role of IT at UTAS, specifically.</p>\n<p>Another source of data is the University of Tasmania Student Matters Forum hosted each year since its launch in 2013. At the 2014 Students Matter Forum a workshop focused on gathering students&rsquo; perceptions of their learning experiences.</p>\n<p>The focus of this workshop is to gain insights into student expectations and perceptions about the nature and quality of student service delivery at the University of Tasmania. What examples of good service have students experienced, and what examples can they provide of where service delivery could be improved?</p>\n<p>Many of the responses provided at the workshop were related to online learning and IT services. It is not evident how the results from the forum informed decision making about those services or how the findings from the forum were disseminated other than making them available on the Students Matters website. As yet, the 2015 report is not available.</p>\n<p>The University also hosts a &ldquo;We are Listening&rdquo; web page where students can give feedback on their experiences. Feedback categories are linked to e-mails to the Head of the service responsible for that area and also centrally collated. Complementing this initiative is the &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Listened&rdquo; web page that lists the feedback provided and the action taken in response to the feedback. Of the three sets of feedback and actions listed, two are directly related to IT services. Although these initiatives appear to be positive ways of garnering feedback and communicating the responses to the feedback, no links to those web pages could be found on the Student Support Services web page.</p>",

The Library also links to a general Q&amp;A service, Ask Us. All the services are made available to all students regardless of their mode of study.

This has been difficult to achieve from both educational and technological perspectives. In relation to the technology, when the LMS was first introduced in 2012/3 the implementation was successful due to strong project coordination between UTAS and the LMS developers, and adequate resourcing for infrastructure and staff training. Since then there has been staff losses, staff turnover, and a change in the administrative structures of the University that has impacted on the ability to maintain the connectedness among various University departments that is required to ensure the LMS platform is maintained, updated, and resourced. There have been inadequate change management strategies put in place to support the application and evolution of the LMS, which needs to occur for it to keep abreast with students&rsquo; use of new technologies and learning needs. The reduction in resources has had a negative impact on the alignment of the support services with the learning technologies over the past few years.

This would suggest that there has been quite an investment made in setting up these services. Students&rsquo; main point of entry is via Current Students. As expected the portal links directly to academic services, such as the Library, eStudent, webmail, student administration, and course information as well as specific learning support services, such as Student Advisers and Online Computer Skills tutorials.</p>\n<p>Another element of the Student Support services provided online are related to beginning students&rsquo; transition into university study, which are put in place to foster student resilience with the aim of enabling them to progress through an academic degree successfully. There are links to a Student Advisers, First Year Facebook page, Student Life, Starting at University, and First Steps for New Students.</p>\n<p>Support for these students&rsquo; services are provided through the Ask Us portal. The support is offered as an email contact service as well as a personal phone contact service. Both offerings of the service are understaffed. Typically, contact by phone is greeted by a &ldquo;all the operators are busy&rdquo; message and the option to wait or provide contact details, be placed in a queue, and receive a call back is given. When the call back selection was chosen, the call was returned but it took two hours for the call to reach the top of the cue. An email sent at the same time as the phone call was made was not answered within one working day.</p>\n<p>It should be acknowledged that academic staff are often a student&rsquo;s first port of call for all manner of problems and support in relation to TELT. Occasionally this is useful such as where there is a problem with a LMS unit that can be passed on to the relevant lecturer. This is often unseen workload and not necessarily part of the contacted person&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities. Some Faculties have dedicated Educational Developers responsible for supporting staff to deliver learning experiences online. For example, the Faculty of Education have a Senior Academic eLearning Pedagogue. In some faculties the Educational Developers support students directly (e.g., Faculty of Health, Understanding Dementia MOOC). They usually help a teaching staff member resolve issues but the teaching staff member communicates the possible solutions to the students (this is the case in Tasmanian School of Business and Economics).</p>\n<p>The main source of support for students using the LMS is the Service Desk. Problems arise, however, when the Service Desk staff do not have knowledge of or experience with MyLO to provide sufficient support students. The Service Desk staff are not given access to units at Support/Lecturer level so are limited in their ability to address or resolve problems encountered by students in a timely manner. Embedded in the LMS are learning objects that link to advice about the LMS functions. Similarly, the eStudent Centre has embedded Help links but as is the case with the LMS, the links are external to service and do not always open up in a new browser tab. This can make trouble shooting issues faced within the service quite difficult.</p>"

The Library, IT Service Desk, and the Student Support webpages have links to multiple services and in some cases, the same service can be accessed from multiple places. For example, Ask Us can be accessed from the Library page as well as the Student Support page. This has the advantage of students being able to access services without having to always work back to and from the one place but there is also the disadvantage that students do not always know from where they have accessed a service and find it difficult to return to that service in an efficient manner.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pathways to the IT Service Desk are widely, clearly and consistently communicated. Regular updates about IT Services are conveyed through email contact and advice about contacting IT Services is often attached to queries responded to by email. Requests for assistance can be made through the Log a Service Desk Job link on the IT Services homepage. The link takes students and staff alike, to a Service Portal that has four main options to choose from: Report an Issue; Request Something; Find Answers; and Other Services. Although useful, difficulties in navigating fluidly between the Service Portal and the Service Desk arise. For example, the Report an Issue link sends students to an external Service Portal via an email and password authentication process. Details about problems encountered can be added to a template and forwarded to the IT Services Support Team. The problem arises when the request is completed and the students try to return to the Service Desk. Instead, they are forwarded to an individualised Self Service Portal. It is then necessary to open a new browser tab to return to where they started. The Request Something option on the Service Portal is multi-layered. At first, a selection must be made from three options: Dell Services; Apple Devices; and Service Request. The problem arises when the options at the next level do not cover the problem sought to be answered. For example, a request to upload software is not one of the options under the Service Request option. Although not an issue as such, a request to upload software can only be requested via the Report an Issue option. The Service Request option would benefit from a contact template such as the one in the Report an Issue option. The Find Answers option leads to a FAQ list, which can be searched. Like all other FAQ services, it is only useful if the question pursued has been answered previously and there is the potential for the process to be time consuming and frustrating as users search for the relevant questions that provides the appropriate answers for their problems. Services like the FAQ list are usually provided to avoid answering the same question multiple times and their provision is used to justify reduced resourcing. However, decisions made for economic reasons do not always translate to positive experiences for students and staff.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>"

The earlier investment in e-learning has been dominated by the establishment of the LMS facilities (2012) involving an online learning environment (MyLO) comprising Brightspace and a suite of linked tools such as MyMedia. Capital investment is managed through the Capital Investment Committee (CIC) who have supported projects such as video conferencing installed strategically to support inter-campus communication. Support functions provided by the University&rsquo;s Information Technology Service (ITS) and TILT are budgeted centrally.</p>\n<p>The Schools and Divisions within the Faculties and Institutes represent the spending units and are able to make contributions to the local implementation of TELT, such as supporting professional staff to assist academic staff, local projects and staff development activities. It is likely that all aspects of the University are expending resource on additional extras particular to the needs of their students, for example, the Faculties of Health and Education have recently invested $500K on a new student placement management system (with many learning support features). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The endorsement of the TELT White Paper should have seen a substantial investment in online learning and resourcing criteria aligned to the principles, however funding support for teaching in the institution has been cut overall (for example in the area of student support advisors) and with it the commitment to further investment (other than via specific projects and the CIC). The TELT White Paper should have been translated into operational plans addressing the relative priorities of specific enablers, the resources needed to address them, and assigning responsibility to key groups.</p>\n<p>Currently resources are allocated primarily in support of the central e-learning tools with additional support provided on request by TILT staff on an ad-hoc basis. The University does not, as yet, have a mechanism that is investing in a targeted manner in the improvement of unit e-learning design or delivery, beyond the imperative that MyLO will be used. The institution is Quality Matters accredited and this is reflected in the&nbsp; Blended Learning Model 1-5 Framework where all provision (whether fully online or not) is expected to meet &lsquo;level 3&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The actions around development of open practice in the TELT White Paper has been picked up in the development of Breadth Units (since the runaway success of the MOOC in Dementia Care leading to the Bachelor in Dementia Care).

This should see an improvement in capability, particularly if such an approach is influential on planning for technology use within all units. The ongoing focus on the requirements of the Higher Education Standards Panel&rsquo;s (HESP) Learning Outcomes (Coursework) standard mandated by TEQSA is also likely to encourage coordinated planning in all aspects of unit and course design and implementation.</p>\n<p>The Student Experience Strategy 2016-20 outlines five &ldquo;Pillars&rdquo; (copied below), none of which explicitly refers to online, blended or flexible learning, but which might be inferred through reference to &ldquo;high quality environments&rdquo; and &ldquo;experiences&rdquo; with much of the detail left to the TELT White Paper. The Blended Learning Model 1-5 Framework is much more explicit about use of specific tools in the learning environment, such as discussion, rubrics and gradebook, without being prescriptive. It also refers to &ldquo;high impact learning experiences&rdquo; without teasing out what this means . Possibly as this will vary, discipline by discipline. There is a predominantly ad-hoc approach to any course or unit developments.</p>\n<p>Staff at the University of Tasmania are supported in the use of technology in a variety of ways. In addition to a network of faculty-based educational designers, staff have access to on-demand support provided by the staff of the TILT. Support from TILT is a combination of one-on-one assistance, workshops and online resources including the ELT506 unit and the &ldquo;Planning Your Online Unit&rdquo; document.</p>\n<p>There are also online tutorials for &ldquo;Getting Started in MyLO&rdquo; and &ldquo;Teaching Online in MyLO&rdquo; available to all staff (https://mylo.utas.edu.au/), although these are in need of update as many links are broken and pages fail to load. The &ldquo;Planning Your Online Unit&rdquo; materials provide a useful framework but they are focused primarily on decisions within a single unit, rather than helping staff engage collectively in their use of technology within entire courses and qualifications. The Quality Matters framework also has the potential to raise awareness of how technology use can be planned for systematically in relation to online learning.</p>\n<p>The TILT website provides a range of materials on technology use but these are currently dominated by the technical and administrative aspects, with some discussion of pedagogical implications and options. A particular strength is the alignment of the Quality Matters rubric items into the standard academic performance management systems through Teaching Performance Expectations exemplars, and the resulting systematic encouragement to use technology well within individual units. There is a clear sense that the support currently provided is in the process of being redesigned and redeveloped. The TELT White Paper 2014-2018 notes the importance of digital literacy for staff (enabler 1.4) and outlines a set of competencies expected of staff. The implementation of the Quality Matters framework is also stimulating awareness by teaching staff of the ways by which technology can support learning by providing examples of effective online units. Learning Technologists (professional staff) run ad-hoc sessions on technology (and some pedagogy) in schools. More often staff (particularly sessional staff) are helped by colleagues.</p>\n<p>The White Paper also includes an action regarding recognition of staff engaging in digital scholarship (enabler 5.3) but it is unclear what this means in practice and when it might be enacted. As the various initiatives identified above mature and are integrated more extensively into the University&rsquo;s management systems they will likely provide information on the capability of the staff to engage in e-learning, which can be used to further prioritise investment of support resources. Such systems are currently lacking and so many of the initiatives lack evidence of the current quality of staff engagement with e-learning and are informed primarily by anecdote.</p>\n<p>Many of the initiatives lack evidence of the current quality of staff engagement with e-learning and are informed primarily by anecdote. There is a need for more systematic approach to staff support, both in terms of utilisation of technology and high quality pedagogy in order to maximise return on investment.</p>\n<p>The Quality Matters framework currently being deployed at the University is an excellent &lsquo;standards&rsquo; document that will provide the staff with a model and encourage a renormalisation of expectations around learning design and the use of technology to support learning. The &ldquo;Planning Your Online Unit&rdquo; materials provide a form of standards-like guidance as well. Both of these are relatively recent and so are yet to been fully engaged with across the University and integrated with other policies, systems and processes.

A total of 114 academics across the three campuses completed the survey (n = 110; 21% response rate). Importantly, the survey was completed by both early adopters of technology and those who do not currently use technology in their learning and teaching. Thirty-five per cent of respondents were using technology delivery options for their f2f students while 53% did not use &lsquo;technological delivery options&rsquo;. Most of the academics using ICT to deliver teaching (84%) were teaching in an undergraduate degree program. Thirty-one per cent of respondents reported using technology in the delivery of a postgraduate degree. The largest proportion of respondents used technology to create &lsquo;online&rsquo; or beyond the classroom learning activities. Online activities were also used to support &lsquo;independent study&rsquo; (62%).</p>\n<p>Analysis of the free comment responses regarding how academics encourage independent learning through the use of ICT tools can be categorised into four groups. From highest to lowest: driven through formative and/or summative assessment; social interaction; provision of resources; and delivery mode of the course (e.g. compressed). Linked to assessment 95% of respondents were aware of Bb rubrics and 79% reported using rubrics.</p>\n<p>The survey found that a high proportion of respondents (88%) were using standard communication tools (e.g. Outlook and Bb) and while most respondents knew of social media, very few were users. Similarly, albeit fewer respondents, academics were using tools to share knowledge. However, when asked about the use of tools to curate knowledge, there were fewer respondents across a range of pre-identified tools.</p>\n<p>In the creative space most academics were using standard tools such as word and PowerPoint and 66% were using mind mapping tools. Less than 40% of the respondents reported using a screen capture tool. However, over 50% of respondents used some kind of recording tool to deliver lectures (voice: 18%; voice and image: 30%; streaming: 19%). Fourteen per cent and 27% were using &lsquo;Echo 360&rdquo; and &lsquo;Bb collaborate&rsquo; respectively. One respondent noted that while they did not record their lectures, students captured the lectures on their personal devices.</p>\n<p>It is clear from this survey that academics are seeking professional development in this space. Eighty-five per cent of respondents want to develop their skills in Blended Learning strategies and 79% want to hear about &lsquo;great ideas&rsquo; for activities. Importantly, respondents want technical support (74%). Respondents also reported that support must be ongoing and flexible given the time demands on academic staff, staff turnover and changes in technology.</p>\n<p>H:\\Kathie\\blended learning\\BL_Data_All_151207.pdf</p>"

So an introductory training may be sufficient for most students, and some students may be able to make sense of the system without any training at all.

InterFace includes progressive achievement data and perception feedback to provide staff and students with an overview of course achievements (by semester) with daily updates on unit performance indicators. The InterFace web-page uses responsive design to deliver content according to four themes that inform learning and teaching partnerships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student Details: extracted from Systems of Record, includes: address, email contacts, HECS status, census dates, transcript requests, etc.</li>\n<li>Course Achievements: extracted from the Student Management System; includes: course history, credit points, minors and majors.</li>\n<li>Unit Performance: extracted from data warehouse and learning management datasets; includes: unit by unit learner analytics in graphic dashboard arrangements.</li>\n<li>Perception Data: sourced from three forms of feedback, University Word Cloud, Unit Satisfaction Indicator and ISEQ, that reveal formative changes in mood and satisfaction.</li>\n<li>The InterFace dashboard is our &lsquo;big data&rsquo; portal.

However, this is done on a year by year basis and has largely excluded consideration of educational technologies. A Capital Investment Review is currently underway under the auspices of the Vice-President (Operations) and this will link consideration of the physical and virtual environments in the resource planning for the university.

This references the UC Course Experience Questionnaire (UCCEQ) and the Student Services Survey (2011, 2013 but not scheduled to run again). The UC Course Experience Survey does not mention the technology enhanced component specifically, but does reflect the responding students&rsquo; views about the quality of their learning experience. The Student Services Survey has only been conducted in 2011 and has not been repeated. The 2011 results suggested that key areas for improvement were access to computing equipment and IT Help and support, but does not relate these IT issues to their learning specifically.</p>\n<p><strong>Quality and Improvements Advisory Group</strong> (QAIT) &ndash; high level advisory group which meets 6 times per year and provides advice to the Vice-President Operations on quality and improvement matters related to the scholarly and professional areas of the university.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Environments Advisory Group (LEAG)</strong>: LEAG was established to evaluate and advise the UEC and the DVCE on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes, as well as ongoing implications for learning space design.</p>\n<p>LEAG provides advice to the University Education Committee on the University&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments. Its TOR are below. However, it is not clear that LEAG focuses on TEL at the course and program level. It is more at the broader tools and infrastructure level.</p>\n<p>LEAG TOR</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the nature, quality and fitness-for-purpose of UC&rsquo;s virtual and physical learning environments.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on on existing, new and emerging technologies that could be used in teaching and learning to demonstrate innovation and improve student experience and learning outcomes.</li>\n<li>Provide advice to University Education Committee on the types of learning spaces, learning space design and furnishings needed now, soon or in the future to enable delivery to new and existing student cohorts</li>\n<li>Lead and oversee the implementation of new or renewed learning environments.</li>\n<li>Determine if any issues relating to learning environments require discussion by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Undertake any other activities referred to it by the University Education Committee.</li>\n<li>Report annually to the University Education Committee on its activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Course Quality Framework (CQF)</strong></p>\n<p>The CQF Statement of Principles includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Units and courses provide a high quality learning experience for students that employ best-practice teaching and learning methods and relevant learning technologies; and</li>\n<li>Provide students with the opportunity for work integrated learning and international study experiences, and globally connected learning opportunities through technologies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Dean of a faculty is responsible for the delivery and content quality of the courses offered by that faculty.</p>\n<p>2016 implementation of the CQF has focused to date on the course development process by facilitating &lsquo;quality assurance of course creation by determining market need, latest technologies and teaching practices by discipline&rsquo; (p.6). The course development process explicitly targets learning technologies by requiring proponents to address the principles of innovation and engagement, identified in UC&rsquo;s Strategic Plan. A capacity statement supports, that explicitly requires proponents to consider &lsquo;educational technology tools, creat[ing] diverse and effective online learning environments and experiences, and employ[ing] flexible pedagogies&rsquo;. The UC&rsquo;s Course Development Process has been fully operational since March 2016.</p>\n<p>The CQF also requires course monitoring and Annual Course Reporting. This will manifest as an adaptive quality enhancement model predicated largely on online experience through integration with the InterFace dashboard and associated data and analytics. Technology enhanced learning and appropriate use of technology for learning is an integral part of this model.</p>\n<p><strong>Information and Technology Management Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>The ITM Strategy includes a goal of <em>Transforming IT capability towards a borderless University taking a global position</em>.</p>\n<p>The Strategy includes &lsquo;Develop and promote ITM services to facilitate engagement and experience through technology&rsquo; and &lsquo;Develop ITM consulting services to provide advice and leadership on technology for teaching, learning and research&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The Strategy does not include a focus on quality assurance in relation to teaching and learning, or a focus on integrating technology specifically at a program or course level (see below). However, ITM supports a range of technology services that support the teaching enterprise such as the student management system (Callista), the timetabling system (Syllabus+), the tutorial management system (Allocate), Office265 and OneDrive, and these are integrated to greater and lesser degrees with the students&rsquo; learning experiences of their units and courses through either MyUC and/or the learning management system.</p>\n<p><strong><em>integrate technology enhanced learning at both a program and course level</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Flexible Learning Implementation Plan (FLIP)</strong></p>\n<p>The FLIP is a sub-plan of the University&rsquo;s Education Plan. It is built on assumptions of flexibility, mobility and BYOD. It includes a range of planning and implementation activities to support the design, implementation, management and reporting of processes to update, replace and/or add educational technologies to enable and support learning and teaching innovation, quality student learning experiences, and proper administrative management of the business of education.</p>\n<p><strong>InterFace</strong></p>\n<p>InterFace is a web-based dashboard available to UC students and to unit conveners and other designated staff. It uses analytics to present students with real-time information about their progress towards completing their course and their progress and engagement with each unit in which they are enrolled. For unit conveners it can help build their understanding of the profile, performance and perceptions of students in their units. InterFace captures student engagement as expressed through their use of TEL environments, however, it does not explicit canvas their satisfaction with the TEL they experience. The questions they are asked are related to their satisfaction with their happiness, how well they think they have done, and the alignment of their unit with their career destination.</p>\n<p><strong>Recognition and Advancement Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>Teaching and Learning activities in staff development are designed to support the achievement of the UC Strategic Plan 2013-2017 and the associated Education Plan which have ambitious targets of growth via strategic partnerships nationally and internationally, and additional provision of flexible and online study opportunities for students.</p>\n<p>It provides staff with advice, support, information sessions, online learning, and innovation showcases as well as opportunities for accredited study and support for international certification in the areas of learning design, curriculum design, policy development and implementation, library resources and technical and other support in the effective pedagogical use of our learning technologies.</p>\n<p>The staff recognition and advancement activities are university-wide approaches to supporting the integration of technology into teaching and learning practice, and highlights the pedagogical applications of technology.</p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc447205275\"></a><em>Staff Development for Teaching and Learning Program (the Program)</em><em> includes:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online courses provided by third party providers that UC has purchased (For example, Epigeum&rsquo;s University and College Teaching modules, Blended Learning modules, open courses provided in MOOCs and/or OERu, Lynda.com resources),</li>\n<li>Activities scheduled by Teaching and Learning to provide staff with the opportunity to develop skills in UC learning technologies (see <a href=\"https://www.canberra.edu.au/myuc-s/business-units/dvce/tl/staff-development-and-support/workshop-registration\">https://www.canberra.edu.au/myuc-s/business-units/dvce/tl/staff-development-and-support/workshop-registration</a>), and/or to extend the tools, techniques, strategies and approaches to their own teaching practice and curriculum renewal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Graduate Certificate in Tertiary Education (GCTE)</em></p>\n<p>The GCTE has been redeveloped for delivery to UC (and some partner staff) from mid-2016.

The UC&rsquo;s Course Development Process has been fully operational since March 2016.</p>\n<p>The CQF also requires course monitoring and Annual Course Reporting. This will manifest as an adaptive quality enhancement model predicated largely on online experience through integration with the InterFace dashboard and associated data and analytics.
